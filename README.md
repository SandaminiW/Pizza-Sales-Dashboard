## Project Objective

This pizza order dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends related to a pizza restaurant's sales and performance. The objective is to provide insights into total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and total orders over a specific time period. It highlights the busiest days and times for orders, emphasizing weekends and specific hours, as well as the distribution of sales by pizza category (e.g., Chicken, Classic) and size. Additionally, it showcases best-selling and worst-selling pizzas, helping management identify popular and underperforming items. The dashboard also tracks daily and hourly order trends to optimize staffing and inventory, contributing to better business decisions and customer satisfaction.

## KPIâ€™s REQUIREMENT

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

## Final Conclusion

The final conclusion of this pizza order dashboard is that the restaurant's sales are driven by certain trends that can inform strategic decisions. Weekends, particularly Friday and Saturday evenings, generate the highest number of orders, while the "Classic" pizza category and large-sized pizzas are the top contributors to total sales. Bestsellers like the "Classic Deluxe" and "Chicken" pizzas are critical revenue drivers, whereas low-performing items, such as the "Brie Carre" pizza, may need to be re-evaluated or removed. By understanding peak hours, customer preferences, and product performance, the restaurant can optimize its operations, marketing efforts, and menu offerings to enhance profitability and efficiency.
